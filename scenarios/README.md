# Thought Experiments for MSB/MIB

This folder contains **informal, exploratory material** related to the MSB/MIB framework:
scenario notes, narratives, diagrams, and multimedia.

These files are **not part of the formal specification** of MSB/MIB. They are here to:

- Test ideas about future economies (e.g. 2050, Neuralink, tokenized assets).
- Illustrate how MSB/MIB could behave under extreme or speculative conditions.
- Serve as raw material for future papers, talks, or code.

Because of that, the contents of this folder:

- **May change or be deleted at any time** (no strict versioning).
- **May include multimedia** (images, video, audio) inside `./media/`.
- **Should not be cited as stable references** without checking the main docs.

If you open an issue or pull request related to these files, please treat them as
**thought experiments**, not as a finished theory.
